What is SCM (Source Code Management)? 
aka - "Version Control" or "Revision Control"

Owen's blog post on version control: http://redalt.com/5-reasons-you-should-be-using-version-control

Vocabulary:
working copy - code on which you are currently working
production - code that is out there for the world to see and use
repository ("repo") - official copy of your code (revisions, history, etc.)  
stage - designate as ready to be comitted to the repository; mark as waiting to be committed
commit - put on the repo
revert - go back a version
head - most recent version of the branch in the repo
branch - new avenue of code development
master - main branch
tag - name of a specific commit
remote - a repository that is not on the local machine
pull / push - get code from or put code to a remote repo
merge - integrate changes made by more than one developer
conflict - what happens when code cannot be merged because it's been changed by more than one developer at the same time
resolve - process of handling conflicts
hash - hexadecimal string of characters; labels a commit in the repo

Next we went over basic shell commands.

Files can have (in general) four states: 
-- Untracked (git doesn't know about it)
-- Tracked (git knows about it)
-- Changed (git knows about it and a change has been made)
-- Staged (git knows about it and it is ready to be committed)

rebase - git command that allows you to combine a bunch of commits into one larger commit; powerful command: use with caution!
